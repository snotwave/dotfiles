# My Personal Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles for my Gentoo Linux installation. To set these up on your distro, I recommend using `stow` to create symlinks for each individual package. For example,

```
stow sway
stow waybar
```

will create symlinks to the Sway and Waybar dotfiles in the `~/.config/sway` and `~/.config/waybar` directories for a fully functional Sway/Waybar desktop environment.

# Requirements
In order to use these dotfiles to their fullest, I will list requirements on a per-package basis.

## Emacs

## Newsboat

## Neovim

## Sway

## Waybar

## Wezterm

## zsh
