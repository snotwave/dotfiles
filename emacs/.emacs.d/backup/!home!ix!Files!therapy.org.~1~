1. Mom moving all her stuff up, feeling stressed/forgotten about

   nice about it
   - Came about after driving aimlessly in one direction

     things to just be over and done with
5. Liv back on meds, getting moving done
   - Moment with shattering glass tabletop, extremely dissociative as I did it, feel
     like a massive failure, bull in china shop, unable to get anything right
6. Work--told my performance is lower than it should be given my skillset being
   above that of my coworkers, feeling like I have to severely overwork myself

** Feeling of Self-Disgust
- i fell for the sex avenue every time

    - i did not want the relationship, but my loneliness was being exploited
    - i wanted sex, but the only person offering it was emotionally abusive
      - by saying yes and alllowing myself to be abused as a side-effect, i am the evil one
